# üöÄ How to Run the App Locally

1. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Create a development build**

    Since we use EAS as the build system, you‚Äôll need to build the app for your platform:

    - **Android:**
        ```bash
        npm run android:dev
        ```
    - **iOS:**
        ```bash
        npm run ios:dev
        ```

    This will start a development server and generate a local build for your device or simulator.

3. **Install and run**

    Once you have built and installed the app on your simulator or phone, and assuming you haven‚Äôt added any additional packages, you can start the Metro bundler:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Then, select the platform you want the project to run on.
