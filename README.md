How to run the app locally

1. Run `npm install`
2. Since we are using eas as the build system, we first need to create the build for it so you need to run `npm run android:dev` or `npm run ios:dev` and this will start a development server for you
3. Once you a build for each platform, installed the build on your simulator/phone and assuming you didn't install any additional packages, you can run `npm start` and select the platform you want the project to run in
